​	Since 2.0 has just been released, the function has not been stable. We will speed up the update of the version and keep the update of one version every week. If you encounter any problems, please feedback in time, we will fix it in the first time.



**Physics engine**

Further improve the physical engine, add physical auxiliary line settings, add interfaces, improve annotations

`Within the IDE, you can open the physical auxiliary line through the project settings panel (shortcut F9), and in the code, you can open it through Physics DebugDraw.enable ().`

Physical engine tuning

- Improve the physical auxiliary line, realize the webgl rendering of the physical auxiliary line, increase the open switch

- Change the linearVelocity property of RigidBody to the object type

- RigidBody adds getWorld Center interface to facilitate access to rigid body centers

- Physics class increases the number of rigid bodies, joints and collisions to obtain interfaces口

- Collision Event Increasing Collision Point Information Acquisition Method

- Perfect the annotations of related physical classes and add detailed introduction




**Improve the performance of mini-games**

- Because Wechat does not support scene file upload, the engine adds adapter, can load scene suffix scenario, to load the same name JSON file, the game code remains unchanged, follow-up Wechat supports scene suffix, and then remove the switch.

- IDE add switch can export files such as scenarios to JSON and open them through project settings.
