​	​	After one year's preparation, we finally ushered in the 2.0 beta version. Beginning with 2.0, in addition to continuing to focus on performance, we have made further efforts in improving engine functions, ease of use and scalability. 2D has made a lot of improvements, added component support, built-in physical system, realized visual physical editing, and carried out in 3D. With major upgrades, performance and functionality have been greatly improved, and the Native runtime has also brought a performance leap, while supporting 3D acceleration, there are more than 200 other detailed improvements. The main improvements are as follows:

# 2D

1. **Built-in physical system**

   ​	LayaAir 1.0 supports Matter physical engine, but it is simple support, no deep integration, not easy to use intuitively. With the opening of small games, more and more games need the support of physical engine, so starting from 2.0, we built-in box 2 D physical engine, encapsulated physical components, provided visual editing of physical attributes of IDE, so that making physical games more convenient and faster. The reason why the physical engine changed from Matter to box2d is that Matter is not very precise and has no penetration-proof support. There are some inexplicable problems when making some kinds of games, and box2d is more perfect than box2d.

   ​

2. **Component-based support**

   ​	1.0 We provide simple script extension support. With the growing number of users and the increasing complexity of requirements, expansion becomes a common requirement. In order to improve the experience of this requirement, we added the support of componentized script. If the default component provided by the government can not meet the requirement, we can improve the function of the component by script extension, so as to realize the personalized requirement. Component development is also helpful in functional abstraction, reuse and development efficiency. At the same time, we keep the way of inheritance of page base class, which is very convenient when dealing with UI logic.

   ​	[Small Tips] Compared with page inheritance, if script is page-level logic, you need to access multiple elements in the page frequently. Use inheritance method. If it is a separate small module, the function is single-multiplexed. It is recommended to use script mode.

   ​	See more component support documentation for details. ：https://ldc2.layabox.com/doc/?nav=zh-as-2-4-0

3. **Scene based management**

   ​	2.0 We provide a scenario-based management approach, developers only need to pay attention to the creative design of the scene, the rest of the scene loading, switching, resource loading, atlas use, resource destruction, etc., the engine provides a complete solution, the original need What the main process does, now the engine is also provided, which simplifies the development cost and allows everyone to spend more time on game design.

   ​

4. **Customizable compilation and debuggin**

   ​	2.0 We use gulp automation script to build the compilation and test process. The whole compilation and debugging process can be connected in series by script task. If you want to insert a custom new process in the middle of compilation and debugging, such as copy; compression, etc., just use Add a new task to the gulp file, so that each project can be customized and intelligent.

   ​	At the same time, the engine supports require by default, so a large number of third-party nodejs libraries can be directly used in the engine.

   ​	At the same time, the WeChat mini-game debugging mode has been improved, and debugging can be performed while developing, and debugging is not required after release.

   ​	In subsequent versions, the release panel will also be reconstructed by scripting customization, so that the release of personalized requirements will not worry.

5. **3D editor**

   ​	Beginning with 2.0, IDE has added support for editing 3D projects. It can edit 3D scenes, materials, physics and other functions in IDE.

   ​	Because the test version is still under improvement, the test version is not open for use for the time being.

6. **New layacloud project**

   ​	LayaCloud Game Server Cluster is based on the rapid development of multiplayer game design, with high reliability and easy expansion as the primary goal, to simplify the cost of server development. For more information, please refer to https://wiki.cloud.layabox.com/

7. **Brand new IDE**

   ​	2.0 We redesigned the skin and layout of IDE to make it more concise and beautiful. At the same time, we made a lot of functional improvements to further improve ease of use and development efficiency, so that we can hold a meeting in actual use.

# 3D

1. **performance**
  ​     As we all know, LayaAir has always been famous for its performance. In addition to many enhancements and improvements in function and ease of use, LayaAir3D 2.0 has made a significant improvement in performance. A lot of reconfiguration and upgrade of the underlying layer have been done, and a lot of optimization has been done for both static and dynamic models, especially for the performance of static scenes. At the same time, more advanced mechanisms are adopted to reduce the number of calls to JS and WebGL local interfaces to improve performance.

2. **Material system**
   ​     LayaAir 2.0 has made many improvements and improvements in material quality, and has provided more official materials in the engine and opened up more functions related to custom materials. The main new official materials include PBRStandard Material, PBRSpecular Material and UnlitMaterial materials. PBR material is also a popular physical rendering material in recent years, using more scientific shader algorithm to express a more realistic sense of material. UnlitMaterial is a simplified version of illumination-free material, which is generally used for skill effects, etc. Many special effects can be achieved by adding color or transparent mixing combined with rigid animation. In the aspect of customizing Shader, we mainly add multi-pass functions, such as the edge effect needed for cartoon rendering, and multi-pass renders many times during shader rendering. Material opens the renderQueue interface, renderqueue is the sorting basis when rendering wizards. Developers can modify the render order of the wizard to which material belongs by specifying the renderQueue value.

   1) Adding Shader Multiple Pass Rendering
   2) Open renderQueue, developers can customize the rendering order
   3) New UnlitMaterial Material
   4) Add Effect material
   5) Added PBRStandard Material Material Material
   6) New PBRSpecular Material Material Material

3. **Texture system**
  ​     LayaAir2.0 improves the texture function and increases the flexibility and controllability of texture. Mipmap is to generate multilevel theory, format is texture format (such as R8G8B8 and R8G8B8A8), wrapModeU and wrapModeV are texture addressing mode, filter mode is texture filter mode, anisoLevel is anisotropic filter mode. Adding the interface of texture upload pixels, developers can upload custom pixel colors to generate texture. Support GPU texture compression (Android, IOS), specifically ETC, PVR, can significantly reduce the footprint, increase the total amount of game resources, improve the quality of the game.

  1) Adding multiple texture parameter configurations(mipmap、format、wrapModeU、wrapModeV、filterMode、anisoLevel)
  2) Adding Texture Upload Pixel Interface
  3) GPU texture compression

4. **Animation system**
  ​     LayaAir2.0 has a more perfect animator animation system, which can support more animation attributes, support animation transition fusion, move-over switching is more natural, and avoid flashing phenomenon when two non-coherent actions are switched. Animator supports multi-layer animation mixing, which can separate upper and lower parts of the animation and other functions. Each layer can independently control certain bones. Animator animation is adjusted to real-time interpolation, which can greatly reduce memory and improve animation fluency performance at the same frame rate.

  1) New Animator Animation Fusion Function CroFade
  2) Multilayer Mixed Play of New Animation
  3) The animation update mechanism is adjusted to real-time interpolation, which greatly reduces memory and animation fluency performance.
  4) Adding animation with multiple material attributes

5. **physical system**
    ​     LayaAir 1.0 has very few physical functions. 2.0 focuses on the physical system reconfiguration design. Adding a variety of new physical components, including Rigid Body, Physics Collider, Character Controller, developers can choose different physical components according to project requirements. Adding multiple Shapes, developers can add one or more Shapes to describe the outline of physical components at will.

    1)New rigid body:RigidBody
    2)New Collider:PhysicsCollider
    3)New Role Controller:CharacterController
    4)New Collider Shape:BoxColliderShape、CapsuleColliderShape、CompoundColliderShape、ConeColliderShape、CylinderColliderShape、SphereColliderShape、MeshColliderShape
    5)Added auxiliary detection function:shapeCast、shapeCastAll Wait

6. **Sprite**
     ​     New trailing elves are added to achieve the stretching effect of trailing. The commonly used three-dimensional effects are particle, Mesh plus rigid animation, and the new trailing in this 2.0. At the same time, we have added the Pixel Line Wizard to draw the Pixel Line Frame. This general re-game or some debugging mode in the development process are more useful.

     1) Add TrailSprite3D
     2) Add PixelLineSprite3D

7. **Script system**
    ​     LayaAir2.0 pays great attention to the improvement of engine usability. Many callback functions are added to the script, including callback of collision feedback and mouse pick-up of three-dimensional model. Specifically onCollisonXX is triggered when physical collision occurs, including entry collision, keeping collision and exit collision. We are in the later version of 1.0. The onTriiggerXX function has been provided.

    ​	1) Add onCollision Enter, onCollision Stay, onCollision Exit, onMouseDown, onMouseDrag, onMouseClick, onMouseUp, onMouseEnter, onMouseOver, onMouseOut collision callback functions.

8. **Other**
    ​     For resource release, LayaAir 1.0 has always been a headache for developers. In LayaAir 2.0, we officially use destroy Unused Resources () to simulate GC releasing unused resources of the current scenario tree species. LayaAir2.0 optimizes the display of illumination maps, which makes the display of HDR color more realistic than 1.0.

    1) New batch resource release function
    2) Adding HDR Illumination Mapping Format
