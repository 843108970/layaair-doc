# LayaNative2.0.1

Bug fixed
1、Modify the JS call to the ObjectC function, in some cases crash bugs. (modified LayaNative underlying code)
2、Modify bugs that use trailing effects in 3D projects and have no effect on LayaNative. (Modified LayaAir Engine Code)
3、Modify the 2D project to use cacheAs="bitmap", in some cases, display an error bug. (modified LayaAir engine code)
4、The special code for integrating LayaNative in LayaAir is simplified to make the code more concise. (Modified LayaAir Engine Code)

Warning：
1、Due to the recent update of the chrome version to 69, it is impossible to set breakpoint debugging manually in LayaNative environment due to debugging JS on the real machine：
	Developers can debug by writing debuggers in their code.
	Install a version of Chrome 68 for debugging.
2、Because the new Android SDK is updated, the APK of the tester can not be updated automatically. Developers need to delete the APK manually and download it again.

Our engine group will solve this problem as soon as possible, which will cause inconvenience to you. Please forgive me.
